# express-demo

## Description
A small tutorial to demo how NodeJS and ExpressJS works. This does not connect to an actual database but just uses a built-in memory list.

## Usage

To start:

> node index.js -> start with just node
> nodemon index.js -> start with nodemon (will automatically restart after making changes)

npm start -> start with just node

npm run nodemon -> start with nodemon

## Technology Used

- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- Nodemon -> a package that allows you to start the application, nodemon will wtach for changes and automatically restart when changes are mde.
- ExpressJS -> a framework / package that allows you to add REST api endpoints to a node project.
- joi -> really useful package for data / input validation
